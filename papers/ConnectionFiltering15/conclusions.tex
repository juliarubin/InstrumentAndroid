\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Non-essential communication can impair the transparency of device
operation, silently consume device resources, and ultimately undermine
user trust in the mobile application ecosystem. Our analysis shows
that non-essential communication is quite common in 
top-popular Android applications in the Google Play store. Fortunately,
our static analysis can support the identification and removal of
non-essential communication and promote the development of more
transparent and trustworthy mobile applications.
