\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
%An empirical analysis of multiple top-popular Android application from the Google Play store,
%reveals that a large number of information release sites exercised by the applications do not lead to any noticeable affect on the observable application functionality. 
%More specifically, failures to establish connection at these sites are either silently ignored by the application or written to the log file, without being propagated to the user.
%
%Inspired by the study, we devise a static application analysis technique for identifying case when connection failures are
%``silently''  treated, i.e., when information about a connection failure is not propagated back to the application user.
%We evaluate the technique on the ``truth set'' produced manually during the above empirical analysis and show that it is able to identify xx\% of the ``silent'' information releases, introducing only yy false-positive results. 
%Applying the analysis on additional zz top-popular applications from Google Play reveals that ww\% of connection sites established by these applications are effectively
