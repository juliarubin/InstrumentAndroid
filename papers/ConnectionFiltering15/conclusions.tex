\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Covert communication can impair the transparency of device
operation, silently consume device resources, and ultimately undermine
user trust in the mobile application ecosystem. Our analysis shows
that covert communication is quite common in 
top-popular Android applications in the Google Play store. 
Our results show that our static analysis can effectively 
support the identification and removal of
covert communication and promote the development of more
transparent and trustworthy mobile applications.
