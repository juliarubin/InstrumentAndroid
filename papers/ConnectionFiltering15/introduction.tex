\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro} 
Mobile applications enjoy almost permanent connectivity and ability to exchange information with their own backends, third-party servers and other applications installed on the same device. 
Recent studies show that during this information exchange, applications often release sensitive information about their users, such as location, phone number or unique device id~\cite{Enck:Gilbert:Chun:Cox:Jung:McDaniel:Sheth:OSDI10, Egele:Kruegel:Kirda:Vign:NDSS11,Tripp:Rubin:SEC14}. 
With privacy being an increased concern, follow-up works investigate feasibility of obfuscating or completely blocking such release of sensitive information~\cite{Hornyack:Han:Jung:Schechter:Wetherall:CCS11}.
Yet, users often deliberately trade their privacy for receiving a desired service from an application, 
e.g., finding friends within a certain radius from their current location. 
In such cases, preventing the release of the user's location would render an application privacy-preserving but effectively useless. 

Once an application gains access to the user's sensitive information, it can, in addition to utilizing the information for the purpose assumed by the user, also release it to unauthorized third parties.
Permission systems of contemporary mobile platforms cannot prevent such scenarios as they only require applications to declare the \emph{type} of information they want to access, not the \emph{purpose} of the access. 
Existing information leakage detection techniques for mobile applications~\cite{Enck:Gilbert:Chun:Cox:Jung:McDaniel:Sheth:OSDI10,Egele:Kruegel:Kirda:Vign:NDSS11,Arzt:Rasthofer:Fritz:Bodden:Bartel:Klein:Traon:Octeau:McDaniel:PLDI14, Tripp:Rubin:SEC14,DroidSafe} 
also cannot be employed for that purpose: they flag each identified release of sensitive information as a potential privacy breach, regardless of its designated use. 
The non-trivial task of classifying the purpose of information release is then left to the user. 

%This paper aims at distinguishing between the two types of information releases -- those that are expected and are essential for the desired application functionality and those that are not. 

This paper takes a first step towards performing such classification automatically. 
Specifically, we focus on identifying communication statements that can be eliminated without any noticeable impact on the application's functionality. 
%Specifically, we explore the impact of information exchange denial on the behavior of application. 
%An empirical analysis of multiple top-popular Android application from the Google Play store reveals that, in many cases, 
%connection failures are   silently ignored by an application or written to the log file, without 
%any noticeable effect on the application executions.
%In fact, only around 10\% of connection sites exercised by the analyzed applications directly contribute to the user-observable application functionality.
Our in-depth investigation of ten top-popular Android applications from the Google Play stores shows that such statements are surprisingly common. 
%TWe empirically investigate the impact of connection denials on the overall behavior of ten top-popular Android applications from the Google Play store.
We thus propose a static application analysis technique for identifying statements that can be deemed \emph{non-essential}: their failure are silently ignored by the applications
without interfering the applications' behavior.

{\bf Communication in Android Applications.}
We conduct an empirical study whose goal is to explore and quantify the amount of non-essential connections performed by Android applications. 
We focus on the three most common connection types: HTTP, socket and RPC.
The first two are used to communicate with various backend servers -- the application's own and third parties'; 
the last one is used to communicate with other applications and services running on the same device.

Our study is dynamic in nature and is performed in three phases. 
In the first phase, we establish a baseline application behavior. 
Similarly to the approach in~\cite{Hornyack:Han:Jung:Schechter:Wetherall:CCS11}, we record a script triggering the application functionality via a series of interactions with the application's user interface. 
After each interaction, we capture a screenshot of the device to record the application state. 

In the second phase, we instrument the application to log information about 
triggered connection statements. The instrumented apk is then installed and executed on a mobile device using the recorded script. 

In the third phase, we investigate the impact of each triggered connection on the overall behavior of the application.
Specifically, we iterate over all triggered connection, producing a new version of the application with each corresponding connection being disabled. Connection disabling is achieved by replacing the connection statement with the
statement that indicates connection failure, e.g., that throws an exception that occurs when the connection fails due to the device being put in airplane mode. 
We then install the modified application and run it using the previously recorded script. The screenshots documenting 
the execution of the modified application are compared to those of the original one. We consider executions as equivalent if they result in screenshots that differ only in the content of advertisement information, messages in social network applications such as twitter, and the devices status bar. 
We also separately note connections that contribute to presenting the advertisement content, if the analyzed application has any. 

Our analysis reveals that around 65\% of the connection statements exercised by the applications do not lead to any noticeable effect on the observable application functionality.
Slightly more than 25\% of these correspond to HTTP and socket communication. The rest correspond to RPC calls to internal services installed on the device: notably, but not exclusively, Google advertising and analytics, which further communicate with external services. 
Moreover, in applications that present advertisement material, about 60\% of the connections that do affect the observable application behavior are used for the advertising purposes only. 

A manual byte code inspection of the identified ``hidden'' connections shows that failures are often either silently ignored by the application, e.g., with an empty exception \emph{catch} block, or written to a log file without being propagated to the user. 
This behavior is indicative for the connections being \emph{non-essential} for the application behavior and, in some cases, even harmful. 
%
%We claim that these connections, hidden from the user, are indicative for potential unexpected operations performed by an application.
In fact, the only application out of ten we analyzed that leaked the unique device id to the internet did that via such a hidden connection; 
identifying and blocking the connection eliminated the information leakage without affecting the application behavior and other information exchange 
operations that the application performed. 


%We empirically analyze xx android applications from the list of yy most popular free applications on GooglePlay, focusing on the impact of successes / failures to establish connection on the overall behavior of the analyzed application. 
%The analysis reveals that applications ``silently'' handle the majority of connection failures by discarding connection error without producing any visible effect on the user-observable application functionality.  In fact, only zz\% of the triggered connection sites propagate information about a failure (or, dually, a success) of that operation to the user.

\noindent 
{\bf Detecting Non-Essential Connections.}
Inspired by the findings, we devise a static application analysis technique for detecting cases when connection failures are
``silently''  ignored by the application, i.e., when information about a connection failure is not propagated back to the end user.
Our technique searches for cases when exceptions resulting from connection attempts are caught by an application without giving any visual message to the user. 
{\bf TDB: designed to be conservative etc.}

We evaluate the technique on the ``truth set'' produced manually during the above empirical analysis and show that it is able to identify xx\% of the ``silent'' information releases (xxx cases for all analyzed applications), introducing only yy false-positive and zz false-negative results. 

Applying the analysis on additional zz top-popular applications from Google Play reveals that ww\% of connection sites established by these applications can be deemed unnecessary.

{\bf Significance of the Work.}
Our work focuses on benign  mobile applications that can be downloaded from the popular application stores and that are installed by thousands, if not millions, of users.
By identifying and highlighting application functionality hidden from the user, it aims at improving transparency and, ultimately, quality of these applications. 
 
We are largely inspired by the positive trend of improvement that we recently observed in the application development community.
One of its manifestations is the increased awareness of privacy considerations. It is likely that such awareness was affected by multiple studies that highlighted
potential privacy violation in applications from popular application stores~\cite{Enck:Gilbert:Chun:Cox:Jung:McDaniel:Sheth:OSDI10, Egele:Kruegel:Kirda:Vign:NDSS11,Tripp:Rubin:SEC14}.
Indeed, we observed that newer versions of the analyzed applications in many cases no longer exhibit the previously identified privacy breaches.  
This improvement trend reassures and further emphasizes the significance of this work as an additional step towards achieving better application quality and increasing trust between users and application developers. 



%Furthermore, applying our classification and blocking technique to 12 app that were identified as leaking sensitive information in a previous study~\cite{Tripp:Rubin:SEC14} classified all information transfers as non-essential and produced a version of each application that is equivalent to the original one, but does not leak any sensitive information.

{\bf Contributions.}
The paper makes the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It sets a new problem of distinguishing between essential and non-essential release of information by mobile applications in an automated manner. This problem is orthogonal and complementary to that of identifying sensitive information flow, which was the focus of numerous earlier works. 
Highlighting non-essential information releases in existing mobile applications is expected to improve transparency and contribute to the overall quality of the field. 
%Put together, the two allow establishing practically useful, \emph{differential}  privacy: the applications can be restricted to using private information only ``when needed'', without leaking it to unauthorized parties.
\item It proposes a dynamic approach for detecting non-essential releases of information in Android applications which does not require access to the application source code. 
The approach relies on interactive injection of connection failures and identification of cases in which the injected failures do not effect the observable application functionality. 
\item It provides empirical evidence for the prevalence of such non-essential connections in real-life applications. Specifically, it shows that 90\% of the connections attempted by ten top-popular free applications on Google Play fall into that category.    
\item It proposes a static technique that operates on application binaries and identifies non-essential connections -- those where failures are not propagated back to the application's user. The precision and recall of the technique is xx and yy, respectively, when evaluated against the empirically established truth set. 
When applied on the 50 top-popular free applications on Google Play, the technique is able to identify xx\% of connections made by these applications as non-essential.
