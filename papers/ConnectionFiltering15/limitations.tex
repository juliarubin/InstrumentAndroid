\section{Limitations and Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:limitations}
In this section we discuss the limitations of our empirical study and our static technique for detecting non-essential connections.

{\bf Empirical Study.}
Our empirical study has a dynamic nature and thus suffers from the well-known limitations of dynamic analysis: it does not provide an exhaustive exploration of an application behavior, thus the findings apply only to the execution paths explored during the analysis. 
Even though we made an effort to cover all application functionality visible to us, we probably missed some behaviors, e.g., those triggered under system setting different from ours. 
We attempted to mitigate this problem by performing all our dynamic experiments on the same device, at the same location and temporally close to each other.  
We also automated our execution scripts in order to compare behaviors of different application versions under the same scenario and settings. 
We only report on the results comparing these similar runs.  

During our analysis, we disabled connections individually, one by one. We thus could not determine cases then 

uted passes. This is how we compared. 
Several operations in the same connection statement.
Cannot handle cases when two blocked points depend on each other.

Limited number of subjects.
